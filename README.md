# Virtual Pet Keychain

Tamagotchi is so popular right now that almost everyone got one, however it was too pricey for me to actually buy one. Hence, I tried to DIY one and customize with my own ideas.

## CAD Model:
Both case are fit together via simple snap click joints.
It has 3 separate printed pieces. The base, the top cover and a case for the rotary encoder.

I used the ESP32-C3 symbol to represent the actual ESP32-C6 super mini devboard.
